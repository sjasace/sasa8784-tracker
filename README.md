**The development process **

*Motivations*
  The development process began with the purpose and root of why I wanted to do a food related web app. This was rooted in the fact that I wanted to eat healthier and make better meal choices myself, which I know is an issue faced by many. Therefore, I wanted the platform to be something I wasn't just designing for a client but something myself and a range of people could use that actually benefits their lives, and goes beyond the design brief of a 'tracker'. 

With this motive, I have assumed not only the role of a developer but as a user myself. This meant that I could really understand the scope of what I needed to achieve and what I crucially needed to include. I consciously decided to strip the app to its bare essentials to maximise usability for the user. Keeping it to its essentials meant the hill of usability and the user experience becomes a much more simplfied and logical experience. 

**Iterations**

Through the iterations process I really struggled with how the website was gonna flow, since it was one single page. I researched from apps I have on my own devices to see how they utilised single page architecture. I loved how popups look, especially when they have an gray overlay where the content behind was visble but the focus was still on the main pop up. This idea went really well with my minimalism design principle. 

It was noted in the feedback from the web app design assessment that the navigation path for the user is unclear. In regards to this, this weakness stemmed from my own confusion on how to stick to the single page architecture, however, as explained above, pop ups aided this aspect. After the assessment I iterated a look for how the popup and overlay would be approached, you can see this below.

I also combined the calendar and the home page on to the main single page architecture, with a scroll to get to the calendar.

As per the feedback from web app design assessment, the achievements section was lackluster and lacking purpose, which is critical in forming my minimalist design approach, so prior to making the prototype I made the decision to cull the pop up (see recommendations for plans for future)

**Improvements**

The functionality is definitely what needs to be improved on here, the 
**Lessons learned **

The main lesson learned here was to make functionality a first priority and to do all of that frist before making it look as desired with the SCSS. I tried to juggle both at the same time and it only hindered my prototype, rendering it without proper functionality. If I had implemented all the moving parts and then styled it, I would have gotten much closer to the desired final product. It was not a lack of skill, but a lack of poor planning that caused me to be left with a shell of a web app. 

**Best practices**
The best practice here was the home page, which came out, looks wise, exactly as desired, follow on with the minimalist design principle.
The HTML and SCSS was implemented well here, which meant that I had a clear head of what the final product was deemed to look like. 

The spacing was well thought out and made sure that every element was as it was supposed to be showcased. It allowed the "Last Meal" and "Add New" part to stand on its own as well as leaving room for the calendar (after the scroll down)

What it looked like before the implementation:

**Recommendations for future improvement and extensions**

Within the web app design assessment, it was noted that the file upload feature would be difficult to implement, and yes it very much was. So I put this idea forth for a futher extension of the program, so that users can know their meals by more than the name but by the visual features.
